## Seven times have I dispised my soul

* The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height

* The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled

* The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy

* The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong

* The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength

* The sixth time when she dispised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks

* And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue
