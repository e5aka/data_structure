Seven times have I dispised my soul, The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled. The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and committed herself that others commit wrong. The fifth time when she forbore tor weakness, and attributed her patience to strength. The sixth time when she dispised the ugliness of a face. and knew not that it was one of her own mask. And the seven times when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue

Seven times have I dispised my soul 
The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height
The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled
The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy
The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others commit wrong
The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength
The sixth when she dispised the ugliness of a face, and knew not it was one of her own masks
And the seventh time when she sang a sng of praise, and deemed it a virtue
